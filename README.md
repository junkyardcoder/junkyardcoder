- Self taught programmer that is just messing around on the internet.

- I'm interested in making calculators for formulas that normally have to be computed long hand. Specifically working on a Compression/Air Volume ratio for the Airsoft Industry.
- If interested in collabing or working on projects together, hit me up.
